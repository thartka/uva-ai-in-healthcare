title: "NEDOCS: Linear regression"
---

## Clinical hook
Emergency department crowding is measurable, and those measures can drive operational decisions. NEDOCS is one example where a simple linear model can be useful.

## Learning objectives
By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:
1. Define linear regression and its core assumptions.
2. Interpret coefficients, intercepts, and residuals in a clinical/operational context.
3. Recognize common failure modes (nonlinearity, outliers, extrapolation).
4. Describe how a score like NEDOCS can be modeled and validated.

## Why NEDOCS?
(Explain what NEDOCS represents operationally, not the full history.)

## Linear regression in one sentence
(Outcome = baseline + weighted sum of predictors + error.)

## Interactive: fit a simple “NEDOCS-like” model
