# Lecture 1.1.5 – Logistic Regression

## The Problem: Predicting Mortality in Healthcare

In healthcare, we often need to predict **binary outcomes**—events that either happen or don't happen:
- Will this patient survive their hospital stay?
- Will this patient develop a complication?
- Does this patient have a particular disease?

## Vizient Mortality Prediction: A Real-World Example

**Vizient** is a healthcare performance improvement company that provides risk-adjusted mortality models to help hospitals benchmark their outcomes. These models use **logistic regression** to predict the probability of in-hospital mortality based on patient characteristics.

Consider **gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding**—a common, serious condition that requires rapid assessment and intervention. Predicting mortality risk helps clinicians:
- Identify high-risk patients who need intensive monitoring
- Guide resource allocation decisions
- Compare outcomes across hospitals after adjusting for patient risk
- Support shared decision-making with patients and families

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. **Explain why linear regression fails for binary outcomes** - Understand the fundamental limitations of linear regression when predicting probabilities and binary events, including the problem of predictions outside the [0,1] range

2. **Understand the logistic regression model and link function** - Describe how logistic regression transforms a linear combination of predictors into probabilities using the logit link function, creating an S-shaped curve that ensures probabilities stay between 0 and 1

3. **Interpret logistic regression coefficients as odds ratios** - Explain what coefficients in a logistic regression model mean in clinical context, understanding how each predictor affects the odds (and probability) of the outcome, using the Vizient-like GI bleed mortality model as an example

4. **Recognize the advantages and limitations of logistic regression** - Identify strengths (handles binary outcomes, interpretable odds ratios, well-calibrated probabilities) and limitations (assumes linearity in log-odds, requires adequate sample size, sensitive to class imbalance) when applied to healthcare prediction problems

## 1. Why Linear Regression Fails for Binary Outcomes

### The Problem with Continuous Predictions

Imagine trying to predict whether a patient with GI bleeding will die using linear regression. We might model:

**Mortality = β₀ + β₁(Age) + β₂(Sepsis) + ...**

<img 
  src="/img/linear-regress-for-prob-problems.png" 
  alt="Linear regression problems with probability predictions"

    margin: '1.5rem auto',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    boxShadow: '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
  }}
/>

But what does this produce? A **continuous number** that could be:
- **Negative** (e.g., -0.3)—what does "negative mortality" mean?
- **Greater than 1** (e.g., 1.5)—what does "150% mortality" mean?

These predictions are **meaningless** for binary outcomes. We need probabilities that are:
- **Bounded between 0 and 1**
- **Interpretable** as the chance an event will occur


### Visual Comparison

Let's see how linear and logistic regression differ when predicting binary outcomes:

import RegressionComparison from '@site/src/components/widgets/regression-comparison';

::::

Notice how:
- **Linear regression** can produce predictions outside [0,1] and doesn't capture the S-shaped relationship
- **Logistic regression** produces probabilities bounded between 0 and 1, with a natural S-curve that reflects how risk changes with predictor values

## 2. Logistic Regression: The Model

### The Core Idea

**Logistic regression** solves the binary outcome problem by:
1. Modeling the **log-odds** (logit) of the outcome as a linear function of predictors
2. Transforming the log-odds back to probabilities using the **logistic function**

This ensures probabilities always stay between 0 and 1, while still allowing us to use a linear combination of predictors.

### The Logit Link Function

The **logit** (log-odds) is defined as:

**logit(p) = ln(p / (1-p))**

Where:
- **p** = probability of the outcome (e.g., mortality)
- **p / (1-p)** = the **odds** of the outcome
- **ln(odds)** = the **log-odds** or **logit**

The logit can range from -∞ to +∞, making it perfect for linear modeling.

### The Logistic Regression Formula

The transformation from linear log-odds to S-shaped probabilities is the heart of logistic regression. Let's explore this visually:

::::success ✋ Hands-on Activity: The Logit Link Function

Watch how a linear relationship in log-odds space becomes an S-curve in probability space:

import LogisticRegressionDemo from '@site/src/components/widgets/logistic-regression-link-demo';

<LogisticRegressionDemo />

::::

### Key Insights

1. **Linear in log-odds**: The relationship between predictors and log-odds is linear—each unit increase in a predictor adds a fixed amount to the log-odds

2. **Non-linear in probability**: The same relationship becomes S-shaped in probability space—the effect of a predictor depends on where you are on the curve

3. **Diminishing returns**: As probability approaches 0 or 1, the same change in log-odds produces smaller changes in probability. This reflects real-world risk: going from 1% to 2% risk (doubling) feels different than going from 50% to 51% risk

4. **Steepest at p = 0.5**: The curve is steepest when probability is near 0.5, meaning predictors have the largest effect on probability in the middle range

---



This transformation creates the characteristic **S-shaped curve** that:
- Approaches 0 as logit → -∞
- Approaches 1 as logit → +∞
- Is steepest when p ≈ 0.5 (logit ≈ 0)

## 3.  Vizient-like GI Bleed Mortality Model

Here's an illustrative example of how a Vizient-like model might predict mortality in GI bleeding patients. This is a **simplified, educational example** (not the actual proprietary Vizient model):

#### The Model Equation

The model predicts mortality probability using logistic regression with the following equation:

**logit(p) = -7.0**
- **+ 0.055 × (Age)**
- **+ 0.20 × (Male)**
- **+ 0.60 × (Emergency)**
- **+ 0.90 × (ICU_24h)**
- **+ 0.08 × (ElixScore)**
- **+ 0.70 × (CHF_POA)**
- **+ 0.55 × (CKD_POA)**
- **+ 1.10 × (Sepsis_POA)**
- **+ 1.40 × (Vent_24h)**
- **+ 0.65 × (Creatinine_high)**
- **+ 0.85 × (Lactate_high)**

Then convert to probability:

**p = 1 / (1 + exp(-logit(p)))**

::::success ✋ Hands-on Activity: Interactive Mortality Calculator

Explore how patient characteristics affect predicted mortality risk using this interactive calculator. Adjust the patient characteristics on the left to see how the model calculates:

1. The **logit** value (log-odds)
2. The **predicted mortality probability** (as a percentage)
3. The **contribution of each predictor** to the final risk estimate

import GIBleedMortalityCalculator from '@site/src/components/widgets/gibleed-mortality-calculator';

<GIBleedMortalityCalculator />

**Model Predictors:**
- **Age** (in years)
- **Male** (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Emergency admission** (1 = ED/urgent, 0 = elective)
- **ICU first 24h** (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Elixhauser comorbidity score** (integer, measures overall comorbidity burden)
- **CHF_POA** - Congestive heart failure present-on-admission (1/0)
- **CKD_POA** - Chronic kidney disease present-on-admission (1/0)
- **Sepsis_POA** - Sepsis present-on-admission (1/0)
- **Vent_24h** - Mechanical ventilation in first 24 hours (1/0)
- **Creatinine_high** (1 if first creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL, else 0)
- **Lactate_high** (1 if first lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L, else 0)

## 4. Interpreting Coefficients as Odds Ratios

### What Do Coefficients Mean?

In logistic regression, coefficients tell us how predictors affect the **log-odds** of the outcome. But it's often more intuitive to think in terms of **odds ratios**.

### Converting Coefficients to Odds Ratios

For a coefficient β, the **odds ratio** is: **OR = exp(β)**

The odds ratio tells us: **"How many times more likely is the outcome when the predictor increases by 1 unit (or is present vs. absent)?"**

### Interpreting the Vizient-like Model Coefficients

Let's interpret some coefficients from our GI bleed mortality model:

#### Coefficient: 0.055 for Age
- **Odds Ratio per year**: exp(0.055) = 1.057
- **Meaning**: Each additional year of age increases the odds of mortality by **5.7%** (or multiplies odds by 1.057)
- **Clinical interpretation**: Age is a continuous risk factor—older patients have incrementally higher risk, with the effect compounding over decades

#### Coefficient: 1.10 for Sepsis_POA
- **Odds Ratio**: exp(1.10) = 3.00
- **Meaning**: Patients with sepsis present-on-admission have **3.00 times higher odds** of mortality
- **Clinical interpretation**: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that substantially increases mortality risk in GI bleeding patients



### Important Notes on Interpretation

1. **Odds vs. Probability**: Odds ratios describe relative changes in odds, not probabilities. A 2x increase in odds doesn't mean a 2x increase in probability (the relationship is non-linear)

2. **Holding other variables constant**: Like in linear regression, each coefficient represents the effect of that predictor **while holding all other predictors constant**

3. **Interaction effects**: The model assumes predictors act independently. In reality, some combinations (e.g., sepsis + mechanical ventilation) might have synergistic effects not captured by simple additive terms

---

## 5. Advantages and Limitations of Logistic Regression

### Assumptions of Logistic Regression

Logistic regression makes several key assumptions:

1. **Linearity in log-odds**: The relationship between predictors and log-odds is linear (though this can be relaxed with transformations or splines)

2. **Independence**: Observations are independent (no clustering or repeated measures)

3. **No perfect separation**: There must be some overlap between groups (can't perfectly separate outcomes with predictors)

4. **Adequate sample size**: Need sufficient events (typically ≥10 events per predictor variable)

5. **No multicollinearity**: Predictor variables should not be highly correlated (though less critical than in linear regression)

### When Logistic Regression Works Well

✅ **Good for**:
- Binary outcomes (mortality, complications, diagnoses)
- When interpretability is important (odds ratios are clinically meaningful)
- When you have a moderate number of predictors
- When relationships are approximately linear in log-odds space
- When you need well-calibrated probability estimates

### When to Consider Alternatives

❌ **Consider other methods when**:
- You have very few events (rare outcomes) relative to predictors
- Relationships are highly non-linear in log-odds space
- You have many predictors relative to sample size (consider regularization)
- You need to model complex interactions automatically (consider machine learning)
- You have clustered or longitudinal data (consider mixed-effects models)

### Calibration and Discrimination

Two key concepts for evaluating logistic regression models:

1. **Discrimination**: How well does the model separate high-risk from low-risk patients? Measured by the **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)** or **C-statistic**
   - AUC = 0.5: No better than chance
   - AUC = 0.7-0.8: Acceptable
   - AUC = 0.8-0.9: Excellent
   - AUC > 0.9: Outstanding

2. **Calibration**: Do predicted probabilities match observed frequencies? A well-calibrated model predicts 30% mortality for patients who actually have ~30% mortality
   - Measured by calibration plots or the **Hosmer-Lemeshow test**

Both are important: a model can discriminate well (separate high/low risk) but be poorly calibrated (probabilities don't match reality), or vice versa.

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Linear regression fails for binary outcomes** - It can produce predictions outside [0,1] and assumes constant variance, which doesn't hold for binary data. We need a method that constrains predictions to valid probability ranges.

2. **Logistic regression uses the logit link function** - It models the log-odds (logit) as a linear combination of predictors, then transforms to probabilities using the logistic function. This creates an S-shaped curve that ensures probabilities stay between 0 and 1.

3. **Coefficients represent odds ratios** - Each coefficient tells us how a predictor affects the odds of the outcome. The odds ratio = exp(coefficient) describes the multiplicative effect on odds. This allows us to quantify risk factors and understand which patient characteristics matter most for outcomes like mortality.

4. **Logistic regression has strengths and limitations** - It's interpretable, handles binary outcomes well, and produces calibrated probabilities. However, it assumes linearity in log-odds, requires adequate sample size, and may oversimplify complex relationships. Understanding these trade-offs helps you know when logistic regression is appropriate and when to consider alternatives.

## Questions for Reflection

1. Why can't we simply constrain linear regression predictions to [0,1] and use that for binary outcomes? What problems would this approach still have?

2. In the Vizient-like model, why might sepsis (coefficient 1.10) have a smaller effect than mechanical ventilation (coefficient 1.40)? What clinical factors could explain this?

3. How would you interpret an odds ratio of 2.0 for a continuous predictor like age? How does this differ from interpreting an odds ratio of 2.0 for a binary predictor like "male"?

4. What additional variables might improve a GI bleed mortality prediction model? What about interaction terms (e.g., sepsis × age)?

5. How might the coefficients in this model differ if you were predicting mortality in a different patient population (e.g., pediatric patients, elective surgery patients)?
