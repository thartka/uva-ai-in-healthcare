## Welcome

This session is designed to introduce the people in the room. We will focus on shared interests, backgrounds, and perspectives. The formal structure and expectations of the course will be covered in a subsequent lecture.

## Student Introductions and Icebreaker Activity

### AI Self-Portrait Icebreaker

Students are asked to create an AI-generated self-portrait that represents themselves as a future clinician. Any generative AI tool may be used. The goal is reflection, not artistic quality.

Reflective prompts:

- What aspects felt accurate?
- What felt generic or off-target?
- What surprised you?

*I see AI in healthcare as both overhyped and underhyped—overpromising in the short term, but likely to accelerate innovation in ways that are difficult to imagine.*

## What Comes Next

The next lecture will outline the course structure, expectations, and learning goals. This session is intentionally informal and introductory.
